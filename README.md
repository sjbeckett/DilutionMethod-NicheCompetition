Code for: Disentangling the Relative Strength of Niche Competition from Grazing-Induced Phytoplankton Mortality
=============================

Zooplankton grazing is an important process within marine microbial communities and can be estimated using the dilution method. However, the classical interpretation of data measured using the dilution method does not consider the effects of plankton niche competition. We (Beckett and Weitz, in submission.) consider how niche competition may affect estimates of zooplankton grazing; and propose ways in which the relative impact of niche competition to zooplankton grazing could be measured.
