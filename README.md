Code for: Disentangling the Relative Strength of Niche Competition from Grazing-Induced Phytoplankton Mortality
=============================

Microzooplankton grazing is an important process within marine microbial communities and is principally estimated using the dilution method. However, the classical interpretation of data measured using the dilution method does not consider the effects of niche competition. We (Beckett and Weitz, in review.) consider how niche competition may lead to grazing rates being overestimated by the dilution method; and propose ways in which the relative strength of niche competition to grazing could be measured.
